What controllers are absolutely essential for the MVP wireframe as it exists?

> Floors ✔
    1. Get all Floors ✔
> Categories ✔
    1. Get all Categories ✔
> Exclusions ✔
    1. Get all Exclusions ✔
> Items ✔
    1. Get items by user ✔
    2. Create items ✔
    3. Edit items ✔
    4. delete item ✔
> ItemCategories ✔
    1. Add ✔
    2. Delete ✔

everything will have a get all even if it doesn't need it (mostly for testing purposes)

Ok, how do I go about writing the rest of the frontend?

1. Create item navbar button ✔
2. Create item page, form ✔
3. edit and delete button for items ✔

I will also need to do the following per userstories:

1. Edit will need to allow the change of floors and block inappropriate placement per Exclusions
2. I will need to find a solution to make soft delete (and restore) work. Simplest solution is probably just to add an "active" key value.
3. FLoors. Need floors on the main page. Need a calculated property for weight?
