Extras that make sense but aren't in stretch goals:

1. Display categories for items
2. Display exclusions for floors
3. Display actual owner name on items
4. Add DTOs for the rest of the returns for security and sensibility
5. Make soft delete (and restore) work. Simplest solution is probably just to add an "active" key value.
