# Ada's Warehouse

## Problem Solved

Ada's Warehouse is a demonstrative project made to resemble a warehouse where users can create, read, edit, and delete items with the complicating factors of weight limits for floors of the warehouse and hazardous categories that cannot be stored safely on the same floor.

## Technologies Used

- React/JS
- C#/.NET
- EFC
- PSQL
- reactstrap
- CSS

## Future Development

In the future, I would like to add an admin view to the program as well as features such as admin approval for item placement and visual representations of floors in the warehouse with items.
